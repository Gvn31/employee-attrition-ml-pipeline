# Employee Attrition MLOps Pipeline

## Production-Grade Employee Attrition Prediction using MLOps

An end-to-end **Production-Grade MLOps Pipeline** that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave an organization based on demographic and workplace-related information.

This project demonstrates:
- Data Engineering
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- MLflow Experiment Tracking
- FastAPI Deployment
- Docker Containerization
- Prediction Monitoring
- GitHub Actions CI/CD

# Project Objective

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations because it increases hiring costs, reduces productivity, and causes knowledge loss.

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting employee attrition so that HR teams can identify at-risk employees and take proactive retention measures.
